# Repository: gvsig-gsoc2019-topology

This repository is part of the context Google Summer of Code (**GSoC**) 2019 program through the **OSGeo** organization (https://www.osgeo.org/). In particular, this project is dedicated to the creation of new topological rules in the gvSIG desktop application.

gvSIG desktop is the main application of the association **gvSIG** (http://www.gvsig.com/es) and it is an open source Geographical Information System (GIS) with many tools to store, integrate, analyze and visualize large amounts of georeferenced data.

#### Â¿What are the topological rules?

To understand the importance of topology in GIS, it is necessary to know that spatial information is represented in them through different types of vectorial data, among others. Basically, it is data with punctual, linear and polygonal typology. Integrating all this spatial information, which is a function of GIS, involves establishing spatial relationships between different geometrical elements and it is in this context that the geospatial topology acquires great importance. The topological rules, based on mathematical geometry, are implemented to model these relationships and avoid possible erros.
